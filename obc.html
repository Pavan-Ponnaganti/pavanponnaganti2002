        To uplift Other Backward Classes (OBC), both the Central Government and State Governments are running a lot of programs and schemes. Some benefits include:

There is relaxation with respect to the upper age limit for various examinations like UPSC Civil Services Exam.
There is relaxation with respect to the number of attempts for exams.
There is relaxation with respect to cut-off marks (only lower cut-off marks are usually needed to clear exams).
