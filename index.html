            The EWS sub-category is effective from 2019. On 12th January 2019 EWS bill was passed by the president of India. Gujarat is the first state to pass the bill, on 14th January 2019. The Indian government has given 10% of reservation for General category candidates under the EWS sub-category. This 10% do not cover OBC, SC and ST categories.

            This 10% is not considered as a caste certificate but as an income certificate. Candidates who want to attempt for government jobs or want to get admission in schools or colleges and who fall under the EWS category can avail of the reservation issued by the government. To avail of these benefits, candidates have to provide a valid EWS certificate issued by government officials or competent authority.

                Non-Creamy Layer candidates from OBC are entitled to reservations in jobs as well as educational institutions. However, many candidates (and even some bureaucrats) are ignorant about the provisions of OBC reservation.

If you are a deserving candidate belonging to OBC category, you should not miss the benefits of OBC reservation (due to ignorance). In this post, we shall see the criteria for determining whether you fall under OBC Creamy Layer or OBC Non-Creamy Layer.
